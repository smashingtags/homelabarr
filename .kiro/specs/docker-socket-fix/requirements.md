# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the Docker socket permission error (EACCES) that prevents the homelabarr-backend from accessing Docker containers. The application is running in a Docker container and needs to communicate with the Docker daemon on the host system to manage other containers, but lacks the necessary permissions to access /var/run/docker.sock.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a homelabarr-backend service, I want to access the Docker socket, so that I can fetch and manage Docker containers without permission errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the backend attempts to connect to /var/run/docker.sock THEN the connection SHALL succeed without EACCES errors
2. WHEN the Docker socket is mounted in the container THEN the backend process SHALL have read/write permissions
3. WHEN fetching containers THEN the API calls SHALL complete successfully without permission denials

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want secure Docker socket access, so that the container can manage Docker resources without compromising host security.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN mounting the Docker socket THEN only necessary permissions SHALL be granted
2. WHEN the container accesses Docker THEN it SHALL use the least privilege principle
3. WHEN running in production THEN Docker socket access SHALL be properly secured

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent Docker socket access across environments, so that the application works reliably in development, testing, and production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running via docker-compose THEN Docker socket access SHALL work consistently
2. WHEN running on different host systems THEN the socket mounting SHALL adapt to the environment
3. WHEN deploying to different platforms THEN Docker access SHALL remain functional

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a homelabarr user, I want the backend to gracefully handle Docker connection failures, so that the application remains stable even when Docker access is temporarily unavailable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Docker socket access fails THEN the backend SHALL log appropriate error messages
2. WHEN Docker is temporarily unavailable THEN the backend SHALL implement retry logic with exponential backoff
3. WHEN Docker access is restored THEN the backend SHALL automatically reconnect without requiring restart
