# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical errors in the Homelabarr React/TypeScript application that prevent it from compiling and running properly. The application currently has missing dependencies, TypeScript configuration issues, and type safety problems that need to be resolved to restore functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application dependencies to be properly installed, so that I can build and run the application without module resolution errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is set up THEN all required npm packages SHALL be installed in node_modules
2. WHEN importing React modules THEN the TypeScript compiler SHALL find the corresponding type declarations
3. WHEN importing lucide-react THEN the module SHALL be resolved without errors

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want TypeScript to properly recognize JSX syntax, so that React components can be compiled without JSX runtime errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN JSX elements are used THEN TypeScript SHALL recognize JSX.IntrinsicElements interface
2. WHEN React components are rendered THEN the JSX runtime SHALL be properly configured
3. WHEN building the application THEN no JSX-related compilation errors SHALL occur

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper TypeScript type safety, so that implicit any types are eliminated and code is type-safe.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN event handlers are defined THEN parameters SHALL have explicit types
2. WHEN using setState callbacks THEN the previous state parameter SHALL be properly typed
3. WHEN the application compiles THEN no implicit any type errors SHALL be present

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want React component props to be properly typed, so that component interfaces are correctly defined and used.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN passing props to components THEN TypeScript SHALL validate prop types correctly
2. WHEN using React keys THEN they SHALL not conflict with component prop interfaces
3. WHEN components are used THEN all required props SHALL be properly provided
