# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses cross-platform deployment issues where a containerized application works perfectly on Windows Docker Desktop but fails on Linux environments due to CORS configuration, environment-specific settings, and networking differences. The solution will ensure consistent behavior across different deployment platforms by implementing proper environment detection, CORS wildcard configuration for development, and platform-agnostic networking setup.

**Important Constraint:** All implementations must preserve existing functionality and avoid breaking changes. The system will first analyze current code to identify what is already implemented before making any modifications.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want my containerized application to work consistently across Windows and Linux environments, so that I don't encounter platform-specific deployment failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing existing code THEN the system SHALL identify current CORS, environment, and networking configurations to avoid duplication
2. WHEN the application is deployed on any platform THEN the system SHALL detect the environment automatically
3. WHEN running in development mode THEN the system SHALL configure CORS with wildcard origins to prevent cross-origin issues
4. WHEN the container starts THEN the system SHALL validate all required environment variables are present
5. IF environment variables are missing THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages indicating which variables need to be set
6. WHEN making changes THEN the system SHALL preserve all existing functionality and avoid breaking changes

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want CORS to be properly configured for development environments, so that frontend-backend communication works without cross-origin restrictions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application runs in development mode THEN the system SHALL set CORS origin to wildcard (*)
2. WHEN the application runs in development mode THEN the system SHALL allow all HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS)
3. WHEN the application runs in development mode THEN the system SHALL allow all headers
4. WHEN receiving preflight OPTIONS requests THEN the system SHALL respond with appropriate CORS headers

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want environment-specific configuration to be properly managed, so that the same Docker image works across different deployment targets.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL load environment-specific configuration based on NODE_ENV or similar environment variable
2. WHEN no environment is specified THEN the system SHALL default to development configuration
3. WHEN in development mode THEN the system SHALL use permissive settings for CORS, logging, and debugging
4. WHEN configuration is loaded THEN the system SHALL log the active environment and key configuration settings (without sensitive data)

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Docker networking to work consistently across platforms, so that container-to-container and host-to-container communication functions properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application binds to ports THEN the system SHALL bind to 0.0.0.0 instead of localhost for container compatibility
2. WHEN making internal service calls THEN the system SHALL use environment variables for service URLs instead of hardcoded values
3. WHEN the Docker socket is accessed THEN the system SHALL handle both Unix socket (/var/run/docker.sock) and named pipe (Windows) paths
4. WHEN network connections fail THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error messages including attempted connection details

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Docker Compose configurations optimized for development environments, so that I can develop and test without CORS or networking issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using Docker Compose for development THEN the system SHALL include environment variables that enable development mode
2. WHEN Docker Compose starts services THEN the system SHALL configure services with wildcard CORS settings
3. WHEN Docker Compose defines service networking THEN the system SHALL use consistent network configuration across platforms
4. WHEN Docker Compose mounts volumes THEN the system SHALL handle both Windows and Linux path formats appropriately
5. IF Docker Compose includes environment files THEN the system SHALL provide development-specific environment templates

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive logging for deployment issues, so that I can quickly diagnose problems when moving between environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL log environment detection results
2. WHEN CORS requests are processed THEN the system SHALL log origin, method, and headers in development mode
3. WHEN network connections are established or fail THEN the system SHALL log connection attempts with timestamps
4. WHEN configuration is loaded THEN the system SHALL log active configuration values (excluding sensitive data)
5. IF errors occur during startup THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information including stack traces in development mode
